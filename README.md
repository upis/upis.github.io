### Use

You'll need to use our markup style but it's quite easy... So... use "- " for issue title, "> " for issue description and "# " for issue labels (multiple labels are separated by comma). Eg:

```
- As user I want to log in to the system
> The user will log in with email and password
# user,essential
- As user I want to edit my profile
> The user will upload profile picture and update personal data
# user,essential,file
```

This input will generate two issues:
- As user I want to log in to the system
  - The user will log in with email and password (description)
  - #user #essential (labels)
- As user I want to edit my profile
  - The user will upload profile picture and update personal data (description)
  - #user #essential #file (labels)

You can also use "$w " for issue weight (**GitLab ONLY**)

### The space after the character (-, >, # or $w) is required and the **order matters**!! Don't forget!

``` note
PS.: **Order: -, >, #, $w**. You may choose not to use all the options but you must respect the order.
```

Or you can use a JSON file, like this:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Issue title",
    "description": "Lorem Ipsum",
    "labels" : [
      "LABEL1",
      "LABEL2",
      "LABEL3"
    ],
    "weight": 3
  },
  {
    "title": "As user I want to log in to the system",
    "description": "The user will log in with email and password",
    "labels": [
      "user",
      "essential"
    ]
  }
]
```

``` note
We do not store any of your data! If you want to, check the code.
```
